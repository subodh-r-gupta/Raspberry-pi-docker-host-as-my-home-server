# My homelab on Raspberry pi 4
my notes of creating a homelab on raspberry pi
---

So I got a new raspberry pi 4 and I wanted it to turn in to a full fledged home server. 

The basic idea is to have a home server which can do the following -

1- run linux LTS releases
2- a proxy servers for protecting services
3- the following services are needed at home
| Service | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| portainer | for docker container management  |
