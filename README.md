# My homelab on Raspberry pi 4
my notes of creating a homelab on raspberry pi
---

So I got a new raspberry pi 4 and I wanted it to turn in to a full fledged home server. 

## Which services do I want to run on it?

I need a home server which can provide the following services-

### Security Services

| Service | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| pivpn | for accessing services over internet when i am travelling with my laptop  |
| cloudflare ddns | for providing me a dynamic dns server to connect my vpn clients to  |


### Privacy Services

| Service | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| pihole |  for Network-Wide Ad Blocking  |
| adguard |  for Network-Wide Ad Blocking  |

I am going to have pihole and adguard both for side by side comparison. I have been using pihole for years, but heard good things about adguards. So why not have then both and test which one works better for me?



### Server Management Services

### Entertainment Services

### File Sharing Services
